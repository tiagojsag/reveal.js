            <h2>Agile</h2>
            <p>What is (and isn't) agile?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Agile is not dailies, sprints, story points or backlogs</h3>
            <p>Those are practices to implement the principles</p>
            <p>We can use them, or something else entirely</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Agile is not a fixed rule set</h3>
            <p>Agile is about experimenting and seeing what works for you</p>
            <p>We can have our own approach and still be agile</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Agile is not only for developers</h3>
            <p>Many different types of teams use agile</p>
            <p>Agile can help designers, data scientists, ....</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Agile is a set of 12 <strong>principles</strong></h3>
            <p>Agile defines how people approach their teams, their projects and stakeholders</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Agile is for everyone in the team - including customers</h3>
            <p>Agile involves everyone in the project - including customers - in all stages</p>
            <p>Some customers prefer or even require agile practices</p>
            <p>Agile can promote involvement from different roles</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Agile is adaptable</h3>
            <p>Agile comes with toolboxes (XP, Scrum, Kanban, ...)</p>
            <p>Pick what works for you, discard the rest</p>
            <p>If nothing else works, create new tools</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Agile is flexible</h3>
            <p>We already use some of the agile guidelines</p>
            <p>No need for disruptive changes - implement step by step</p>
            <p>Consolidate before moving on</p>
